title: Cross-Platform Cloud CI/CD
date: 2023-04-04
type: Conference
description: More and more teams are leveraging cross-platform development for their web, mobile PWA, iOS, and Android applications. However, if you are still leveraging traditional CI/CD or manual deployment processes, you can still experience release delays and different DX and UX across platforms. A unified system for cross-platform builds and deploys can prevent knowledge silos, speed up releases, and ensure an efficient process no matter what the platform. This talk will cover the considerations when building a CI/CD system to manage web and mobile deployments, and options for implementing a cross-platform CI/CD solution in the cloud.
