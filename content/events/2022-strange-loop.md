title: Time Travel Debugging JavaScript Applications
date: 2022-09-24
type: Conference
description: Developers spend up to half their time debugging, but often struggle to reproduce and investigate issues with existing developer tools. A time travel debugger lets you record a bug then pause, rewind, and fast-forward your application execution to dig in at specific points in time. You can even add console logs and evaluate expressions retroactively to go back in time and debug. This talk will walk through some common bugs that occur in JavaScript applications and how to approach them with time travel debugging. Debug along with interactive recordings using Replay.io to get hands-on practice with debugging real-world examples.
