title: Testing in Prod as Part of the Pyramid
date: 2023-01-13
type: Conference
description: The paradigm of the testing pyramid has changed over time, with developers adjusting the types of testing performed during integration. Unit, end-to-end, and even component and API testing are taken into consideration when designing a testing strategy. With improvements to observability and deployment tooling, can testing in production be a valid aspect of your quality strategy? This session evaluates the current testing ecosystem for pre- and post-deployment, including how to leverage deployment strategies to evaluate the quality of your codebase across the entire software development lifecycle â€” yes, even production.
