event: Mobile DevOps Summit
title: Customizing your CI/CD for Mobile
date: 2022-11-10T00:00:00
type: Conference
description: Traditional CI/CD doesn’t even begin to cover the specific needs of mobile deployments, but building new tooling from scratch or ripping out existing setups can be a daunting, expensive endeavor. In this talk, we’ll cover the specifics of Mobile CI/CD and how you can build a continuous delivery process that supports the full range of mobile use cases and lives alongside your existing infrastructure. We’ll also discuss where traditional CI/CD falls short and best practices for reliably building, testing, and releasing high quality mobile apps.
