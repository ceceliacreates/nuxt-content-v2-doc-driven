description: Replay.io helps the OSS community by making it easier for maintainers and contributors to debug user issues and automated test failures. With Replay, see exactly what happened when a bug occurred, debug within the recording, and collaborate with other contributors. In this video, Cecelia shows @blackgirlbytes how to use Replay and highlight http://replayable.dev, an open-source project for finding GitHub issues ready for debugging. They also talk about non-code ways to contribute to OSS, including bug reports, documentation, and community support.
